/**
 * CTxMemPool stores valid-according-to-the-current-best-chain
 * transactions that may be included in the next block.
 *
 * Transactions are added when they are seen on the network
 * (or created by the local node), but not all transactions seen
 * are added to the pool: if a new transaction double-spends
 * an input of a transaction in the pool, it is dropped,
 * as are non-standard transactions.
 *
 * CTxMemPool::mapTx, and CTxMemPoolEntry bookkeeping:
 *
 * mapTx is a boost::multi_index that sorts the mempool on 4 criteria:
 * - transaction hash
 * - feerate [we use max(feerate of tx, feerate of tx with all descendants)]
 * - time in mempool
 * - mining score (feerate modified by any fee deltas from PrioritiseTransaction)
 *
 * Note: the term "descendant" refers to in-mempool transactions that depend on
 * this one, while "ancestor" refers to in-mempool transactions that a given
 * transaction depends on.
 *
 * In order for the feerate sort to remain correct, we must update transactions
 * in the mempool when new descendants arrive.  To facilitate this, we track
 * the set of in-mempool direct parents and direct children in mapLinks.  Within
 * each CTxMemPoolEntry, we track the size and fees of all descendants.
 *
 * Usually when a new transaction is added to the mempool, it has no in-mempool
 * children (because any such children would be an orphan).  So in
 * addUnchecked(), we:
 * - update a new entry's setMemPoolParents to include all in-mempool parents
 * - update the new entry's direct parents to include the new tx as a child
 * - update all ancestors of the transaction to include the new tx's size/fee
 *
 * When a transaction is removed from the mempool, we must:
 * - update all in-mempool parents to not track the tx in setMemPoolChildren
 * - update all ancestors to not include the tx's size/fees in descendant state
 * - update all in-mempool children to not include it as a parent
 *
 * These happen in UpdateForRemoveFromMempool().  (Note that when removing a
 * transaction along with its descendants, we must calculate that set of
 * transactions to be removed before doing the removal, or else the mempool can
 * be in an inconsistent state where it's impossible to walk the ancestors of
 * a transaction.)
 *
 * In the event of a reorg, the assumption that a newly added tx has no
 * in-mempool children is false.  In particular, the mempool is in an
 * inconsistent state while new transactions are being added, because there may
 * be descendant transactions of a tx coming from a disconnected block that are
 * unreachable from just looking at transactions in the mempool (the linking
 * transactions may also be in the disconnected block, waiting to be added).
 * Because of this, there's not much benefit in trying to search for in-mempool
 * children in addUnchecked().  Instead, in the special case of transactions
 * being added from a disconnected block, we require the caller to clean up the
 * state, to account for in-mempool, out-of-block descendants for all the
 * in-block transactions by calling UpdateTransactionsFromBlock().  Note that
 * until this is called, the mempool state is not consistent, and in particular
 * mapLinks may not be correct (and therefore functions like
 * CalculateMemPoolAncestors() and CalculateDescendants() that rely
 * on them to walk the mempool are not generally safe to use).
 *
 * Computational limits:
 *
 * Updating all in-mempool ancestors of a newly added transaction can be slow,
 * if no bound exists on how many in-mempool ancestors there may be.
 * CalculateMemPoolAncestors() takes configurable limits that are designed to
 * prevent these calculations from being too CPU intensive.
 *
 * Adding transactions from a disconnected block can be very time consuming,
 * because we don't have a way to limit the number of in-mempool descendants.
 * To bound CPU processing, we limit the amount of work we're willing to do
 * to properly update the descendant information for a tx being added from
 * a disconnected block.  If we would exceed the limit, then we instead mark
 * the entry as "dirty", and set the feerate for sorting purposes to be equal
 * the feerate of the transaction without any descendants.
